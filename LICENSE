Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

This is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works,
specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
this license is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
all versions of a programâ€”to make sure it remains free software for
all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. This license is designed to make sure that you have the freedom
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you
wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that
you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs,
and that you know you can do these things.

Developers that use this license protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the
software.

A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
incorporate. Many developers of free software are heartened and
encouraged by the resulting cooperation.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution, and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

1. Definitions.

"This License" refers to this custom free software license.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

1. Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.

2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.

You may make, run, and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.

3. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License.

4. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program. However, nothing other than this License
grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These
actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore,
by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance
of this License to do so.

5. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

6. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program and want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software that everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
